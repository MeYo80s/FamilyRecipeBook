# Classic Sourdough Bread

**Recipe Owner:** Kristine  
**Serves/Yield:** 1 loaf (about 12 slices)  
**Prep time:** 30 min (active)  
**Cook time:** 48-51 min  
**Estimated macros (est.):** ~170 cal | 6g protein | 0g fat | 35g carbs (per slice, about 12 slices)

### Ingredients
- 150 g sourdough starter
- 10 g salt (Redmond real salt is close to 1 tsp)
- 300 g water
- 450 g flour (half all-purpose, half bread flour)

### Instructions
1. Measure and mix: in a bowl, combine starter, salt, water, and flour. Mix with a dough hook for about 5 minutes. Cover the bowl.
2. Stretch and fold: after a few minutes, wet your hand, pull the dough up from the side, and fold toward the center. Rotate the bowl a quarter turn and repeat. Do this at least twice within the first hour, 5-10 minutes apart.
3. Bulk rise: let dough rise 6-8 hours, until roughly doubled. Don’t let it over-proof and start to collapse.
4. Shape: turn dough onto a floured surface and shape into a tight ball. Line a Dutch oven with parchment and place dough inside to rise.
5. Second rise: let dough rise about 2 hours (longer if cool, shorter if warm).
6. Preheat: heat oven as hot as it will go (about 500°F), then reduce to 420°F.
7. Score: score the top with a sharp knife, razor, or lame.
8. Bake: bake in the Dutch oven at 420°F for 45 minutes. Remove loaf from Dutch oven and bake directly on the rack 3-6 minutes to brown the crust.

### Family Notes
- I took this sourdough class with my sister-in-law Lindy.
- This recipe works well in a 4-5 quart Dutch oven.
- You can reuse parchment paper 3-4 times if you want.
