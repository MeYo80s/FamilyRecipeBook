### Ingredients
- 1 onion, diced
- 2-3 celery stalks, diced
- Potatoes, peeled and diced (about 2 lb)
- Water (enough to cover potatoes)
- 4 tbsp butter
- 1/4 cup flour
- 2 cups milk
- Salt, to taste
- Pepper, to taste
- 1-2 cups frozen peas

### Instructions
1. In a large pot, combine onion, celery, and potatoes. Add enough water to just cover the potatoes.
2. Bring to a boil, then simmer until the potatoes are tender.
3. Make a white sauce: melt butter in a saucepan, whisk in flour, then slowly whisk in milk. Season with salt and pepper and cook until thickened.
4. Pour the white sauce into the potato mixture without draining the cooking water. Stir to combine.
5. Add frozen peas and cook until heated through. Season to taste and serve.

### Family Notes
- Keep the potato cooking water in the pot; it helps the soup thicken.
