### Ingredients
- 1 package (1/4 oz) active dry yeast
- 3 tbsp warm water (110 F to 115 F)
- 1/3 cup 2% milk
- 1/4 cup sugar
- 1/4 cup butter, melted
- 2 large eggs
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 3 to 3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

### Filling
- 11 oz cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 cup sugar
- 1 large egg
- 1 tsp grated lemon zest

### Icing
- 1/2 cup confectioners' sugar
- 1/4 tsp vanilla extract
- 2 to 3 tsp 2% milk

### Instructions
1. In a large bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water.
2. Add milk, sugar, butter, eggs, salt, and 2 cups flour; beat on low speed for 3 minutes.
3. Stir in enough remaining flour to form a soft dough.
4. Turn onto a floured surface; knead until smooth and elastic, about 6-8 minutes.
5. Place dough in a greased bowl, turning once to grease top. Cover and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour.
6. For filling, beat cream cheese, sugar, egg, and lemon zest until fluffy; set aside.
7. Punch dough down. Roll into a 14 x 12-inch rectangle.
8. Place on a greased baking sheet. Spread filling down the center third.
9. Cut 1-inch-wide strips along both long sides; fold strips alternately over filling at an angle to form a braid.
10. Cover and let rise for 30 minutes.
11. Bake at 375 F for 25-30 minutes until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack.
12. For icing, mix confectioners' sugar, vanilla, and enough milk to drizzle; drizzle over warm bread.

### Family Notes
