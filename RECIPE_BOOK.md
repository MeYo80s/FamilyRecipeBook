3. Bulk rise: let dough rise 6-8 hours, until roughly doubled. Don’t let it over-proof and start to collapse.
4. Shape: turn dough onto a floured surface and shape into a tight ball. Line a Dutch oven with parchment and place dough inside to rise.

6. Preheat: heat oven as hot as it will go (about 500°F), then reduce to 420°F.
7. Score: score the top with a sharp knife, razor, or lame.
8. Bake: bake in the Dutch oven at 420°F for 45 minutes. Remove loaf from Dutch oven and bake directly on the rack 3-6 minutes to brown the crust.
